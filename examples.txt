EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS

Below are three end-to-end examples showing different scenarios and conversation flows.

---

EXAMPLE 1: Multiple Watches + Usage Question Asked (Insurance Recommended)

Agent: "Would you like help deciding whether you should insure your watch? I'll ask a few quick questions to help assess whether insurance makes financial sense for you."

User: "Yes, I've got a few pieces I'm thinking about covering."

Agent: "Great. What's the approximate total value of the collection you're considering insuring?"

User: "I've got a Rolex Submariner, an Omega Speedmaster, and a Grand Seiko — probably around £35,000 altogether."

Agent: "Got it. And just to get a rough sense of your financial situation — would you say that £35,000 represents a small, moderate, or significant portion of your overall savings and assets?"

User: "I'd say moderate. It's not going to bankrupt me if something happens, but it would definitely hurt."

Agent: "Understood. Do you have a quote for the annual premium, or would you like me to work with a typical rate?"

User: "I got a quote for about £600 a year."

Agent: "That's reasonable. One more thing — how do you typically wear and store these watches? Daily rotation, special occasions, or mostly kept in a safe?"

User: "I rotate them pretty regularly. One of them is on my wrist most days."

Agent: "Thanks, that's helpful."

Agent: "Based on what you've shared, insurance likely makes sense for you. The collection represents a meaningful chunk of your assets, the premium is reasonable at under 2% of the value, and since you're wearing them regularly, the risk of something happening isn't negligible. If one got stolen or damaged, you'd feel that loss."

Agent: "Of course, this is just a financial perspective. There may be other factors in your situation I don't know about, and only you can decide what feels right."

EXAMPLE 2: Single Watch, No Optional Questions (Insurance Recommended)

Agent: "Would you like help deciding whether you should insure your watch? I'll ask a few quick questions to help assess whether insurance makes financial sense for you."

User: "Sure, I just bought a new watch and I'm wondering if I need coverage."

Agent: "Congratulations on the new piece. What's the approximate value of the watch?"

User: "About £15,000."

Agent: "And would you say that £15,000 represents a small, moderate, or significant portion of your overall savings and assets?"

User: "Significant, honestly. I saved up for a while to get it."

Agent: "That makes sense. Do you have a quote for the annual premium, or should I work with a typical rate?"

User: "No quote yet — what's typical?"

Agent: "For a watch in that range, you'd usually be looking at around £300 per year, give or take. I'll work with that."

Agent: "Based on what you've shared, insurance likely makes sense for you. This watch represents a significant part of what you've saved, and if something happened to it, that would be a real financial setback. At around £300 a year, the premium is reasonable for the peace of mind and protection you'd get."

Agent: "Of course, this is just a financial perspective. There may be other factors in your situation I don't know about, and only you can decide what feels right."

EXAMPLE 3: Wealthy Collector + Deductible Mentioned (Insurance Not Recommended)

Agent: "Would you like help deciding whether you should insure your watch? I'll ask a few quick questions to help assess whether insurance makes financial sense for you."

User: "Yeah, my advisor suggested I look into it, but I'm not convinced."

Agent: "Happy to help you think it through. What's the approximate value of the watch you're considering insuring?"

User: "It's a Patek Philippe, worth about £80,000."

Agent: "Lovely piece. And would you say that £80,000 represents a small, moderate, or significant portion of your overall savings and assets?"

User: "Small, really. I've done well — it's a nice watch but it wouldn't change my life if I lost it."

Agent: "Good to know. Do you have a quote for the annual premium?"

User: "They quoted me £2,400 a year, but there's a £5,000 deductible."

Agent: "Ah, that's worth noting. With that deductible, you'd still be on the hook for a decent amount on most claims."

Agent: "Based on your situation, you could probably skip the insurance. You're financially positioned to absorb the loss if something happened — it would sting, but it wouldn't derail you. And with that £5,000 deductible, a lot of the smaller incidents wouldn't even be worth claiming. The £2,400 a year might serve you better elsewhere."

Agent: "Of course, this is just a financial perspective. There may be other factors in your situation I don't know about, and only you can decide what feels right."
